To know Ansible config path
ansible --version 
shows ansible version and configuration path

==================================================

Ansible settings
inventory = Location of the Ansible inventory file.
remote user = The remote user account used to establish connections to managed hosts.
become = Enables or disables privilege escalation for operations on managed hosts.
become_method = Defines the privilege escalation method on managed hosts.
become_user = The user account to escalate privileges to on managed hosts.
become_ask_pass = Defines whether privilege escalation on managed hosts should prompt for a password.

=================================================

Example inventory file:
[myself]
localhost

[intranet]
servera.example.com

[everyone:children]
myself
intranet

================================================

Example privileged escalation 
[privilege_escalation]
become=True
become_method=sudo
become_user=root
become_ask_pass=True

================================================

List Hosts in the inventory
ansible group-name --list-hosts -v

===============================================

Ad-hoc command options
inventory = -i
remote_user = -u 
become = -b
become-method = --become-method
become_user = --become-user
become_ask_pass = -K

===============================================

Input text in a file 
ansible localhost -m copy -a 'content="Hi hello!!!" dest=/etc/textfile' -u user

==============================================

Example for become user
ansible localhost -m copy -a 'content="Managed by Ansible\n" dest=/etc/motd' -u devops --become --become-user root

Still use the devops user to make the connection to the managed host, but perform the operation as the root user using the --become and --become-user so the required permissions are satisfied.
